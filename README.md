The focus is on translating in the Haeyoche speech levelâ€”a polite but informal style suitable for Korean-American (Gyopo) children communicating with their parents. It accepts user input in the terminal and outputs a translation that balances formality and warmth, making it ideal for casual family conversations where direct and natural language is preferred.

Key features:

Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
Allows custom user input for translations.
Designed to generate nuanced translations, considering context and tone.
